**Solution**: Accept Android licenses
```powershell
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

#### Issue: "No connected devices"
**Solution**: Start an emulator or connect a physical device
- Android Studio ‚Üí AVD Manager ‚Üí Start emulator
- Or connect physical device with USB debugging enabled

#### Issue: "Gradle build failed"
**Solution**: Clear cache and rebuild
