# Assets Directory

This directory contains the assets for the Hope Foundation NGO app.

## Images
- Place your NGO logo in the `images/` folder
- Recommended logo formats: PNG, JPG
- Recommended logo size: 512x512 pixels for best quality

## Icons
- Place custom icons in the `icons/` folder
- The app currently uses Material Design icons, but you can add custom icons here

## Current Implementation
The app currently uses a programmatically created logo (heart icon in a circle) but you can replace it by:

1. Adding your logo file to `assets/images/logo.png`
2. Updating the pubspec.yaml file if needed
3. Modifying the logo display code in the home page

## Logo Usage
The logo appears in:
- Home page header
- Navigation drawer header
- App icon (requires separate configuration in platform-specific folders)
